# AndroidApp
# Application Description
The system implements the choice of a place of work, taking into account the required competencies, the level of payment provided and the mode of work. The working mode is presented in two versions: in the office, remotely. 
The choice of a place of work is based on three criteria: the programming language being studied, the desired salary and the working mode. After clicking on the search button, the data that meets all three criteria is displayed in the database with vacancies. 
It is also possible to save the found vacancies to a file locally by clicking on the "Add to favorites" button.
The main screen consists of three text fields (entering the programming language, entering wages and working hours), two buttons ("Add to favorites", "Search") and a text form where all the vacancies found are entered. When the data enters the screen, the scroll bar is activated.
**The SQLite database is used**
